Part 2: Scrape and Analyze Mars Weather Data
Using Beautiful Soup, I exracted text elements from https://static.bc-edx.com/data/web/mars_facts/temperature.html.
I then scrapred the table from the web page and used read_html function to convert it to a pandas dataframe. 
I then cleaned and analyzed the data to answer specific questions. 
I finally exported the dataframe as a csv.
